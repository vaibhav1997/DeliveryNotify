# DeliveryNotify

DeliveryNotify is a simple python script that checks for your delivery status periodically and sends a push notification [macOS only, for now] and a message to your telegram chat.


### NOTE:
  - Currently, works with ekart logistics only.

### TODO:
  - Add multiple logistics tracking mechanism
  - Setting up of the script with env variables
